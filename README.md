# Try it out: https://leon-yarov.github.io/JS_Sand_Sim/

A sand simulator game made with Javascript, HTML and CSS from scratch.

- Hold Left mouse button to draw
- Hold Right mouse button to erase
- Press Space to clear
- Mouse Wheel to change simulation speed



IMHO: There is a much better way to approach this kind of sims. The 'physics' can be done as an animation frames and the tools can be bigger than 1 pixel, so there is room for improvement.
I was trying to make something simple to try practice javascript. Maybe I'll make it better in the future :P
